Look into my eyes...
Why {do} you hide that look?

Look |into my |face,
and show your smile

{Hey} girl in {a} quiet dusk,
you who walk by the river,
with {a} sad shadow |on your |face,
and gentle hair,
and hair as blonde as flax,

my one and only girl, I play to you,
my one and only girl, I sing to you
