Are you alone tonight?
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry, for, let's say, a dream?
Does your memory stray
all the way to the sea and the morning,
on shore when I slept the night there?

Do the things in your room
lose value and pale?
Do you stare at your door
and wait for me?

Is your body full of pain?
...
Tell me sweetheart, you are alone tonight?

I wonder if you are alone tonight.
Sometimes I hear that the world is stage
and that everyone gets as deserved,
like the poet said.

Fate played a trick on me by giving
me love with you my dear
First scene: our introduction
I loved you at first sight
You knew your way,
never losing sight of what you want...

And then, second scene:
you seemed changed, acted strange,
and that I never find out why, sweetheart,
you lied when you said you |love me,
and I didn't have reasons not to trust you,
because, that is that.

But, I will rather live without you,
than listen to your lies.

Now, it's that scene...
I stand alone with emptiness all around me
You, believe me, will no more use me,
and I also know that it's time the curtains fall down.

Is your body full of pain?
...
Tell me sweetheart, you are alone tonight?

Very special thanks, that was all for tonight,
Very special thanks, and goodbye;
Thanks a lot
