I feel madly in love with you,
it seems to me from birth...
Love as secret
lives as memory

I will grow old, I will not know
whether you will weep for me
like I {did} for you

The lips would sing,
but my soul doesn't want...
Not even |she, anymore,
Will not listen to me anymore

I will grow old, I will not know
whether you will weep for me
like I {did} for you
