Talk to me about her, tell all you know
Say whether our parting now hurts her
But don't give me false hope

Greet her {on my behalf}, say hello {for me}
I love her as before
Alas, if I could send her the tears,
the tears would tell her everything

Are you seeing her with someone?  Who's that lucky guy?
Does a shine of happiness glow on her face?
Or she still didn't get over {our} end?

Say hello to her {for me}, greet {her} {on my behalf}
I love her as before
Alas, if I could send her the tears,
the tears would tell her everything

I still haven't met love similar to her,
and I met women, the count of them is unknown
Only she makes my life happy
