I and darling, from mountains two
[We loved] self like that nobody isn't
[We loved] self like Sun and dawn
She from Tara, I from Zlatibor

{Hey} Zlatibor, ask Tara
whether [she remembers] love old
Tara [to him] answers:
"No [it returns] self love old"

[We walked] [next to] clear water,
smelled on forest strawberries
And where ever would hugged sit
one [to another] in love self swore

Now [to me] sorrow my soul [she tears]
[ever since] [to me] [she said] her Tara
{with} sad song from blue distance:
"[She married] self across river Drina"
