I and {my} darling, from two mountains
Loved each other like no couple did
Loved each other like Sun and dawn
She from Tara, I from Zlatibor

{Hey} Zlatibor, ask Tara
whether she remembers {the} old love
Tara answers to him:
"{The} old love doesn't return"

We walked next to clear water,
smelled like meadow strawberries
And wherever we sat in embrace
we swore to love one another

Now sorrow tears my soul
ever since her Tara told me
with {a} sad song from blue far away:
"She got married across {the} river Drina"
