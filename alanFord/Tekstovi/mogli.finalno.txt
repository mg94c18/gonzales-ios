We could have {done} anything
if the day had been longer
if you had found
a little time for me

We could have {done} anything
if, only, you had wanted
to be gentle
like before

How to find the road
that leads to you?
How to find peace
when everything disappeared?

We could've {done} anything
had you but wanted
to be gentle
like before

There is nobody
in {this} gray city
the streets are stealing my steps
and I am now wandering as a shadow

The rains are falling inside your heart
and everything ours is slowly vanishing
from that world
