We could {have} {accomplished} everything
if the day was longer
if you found
a little time for me

We could {have} {accomplished} everything
if, only,  you wanted
to be gentle
like before

How to find the way
that leads to you?
How to find peace
when everything disappeared?

We could {have} {accomplished} everything
if only you wanted
to be gentle
like before

There is nobody
in {this} gray city
the streets are stealing my steps
and I am now wandering as a shadow

The rains are falling inside your heart
and everything ours is slowly vanishing
from that world
