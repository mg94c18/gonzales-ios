[I feel in love with] you madly,
[it seems] me self from birth...
Love as secret
[she lives] as memory

[I will get old], [I will not] [to know]
whether [you will] after me [to start to cry]
as I after you

[They sang] would lips,
but [she will not] my soul...
Even neither |she (the soul) more,
[she will not] more to me [she listens]

[I will get old], [I will not] [to know]
whether [you will] after me [to start to cry]
as I after you
