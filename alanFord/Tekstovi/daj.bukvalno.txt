[Of these] _ days
although [I am not] [she wanted]
accidentally on street
you [she met]

And you, like and I,
[you are stealing] [to God] days
[I know], [you have] some,
and [you have fun] from side

And I...
No [you know] that [I am] alone
in self's world [of silence]
[I lie] you that [I have] some
some, who about me cares

Give,
don't ask
Without you days are [to me] stupid and empty
Give, don't ask
Because [I live] without you this life as by punishment
