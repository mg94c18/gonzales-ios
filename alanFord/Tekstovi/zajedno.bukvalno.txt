Come closer
Come closer
To [we be] together

All [it is] good
All [it is] good
When [we are] together

[We meet] self on [on same] [on place]
For a long time, for a long time [we stand] on [on corner]
We [we are] happy bunch [of guys]

Our girls [they are] [the most beautiful] in town
Our girls [they are] [the most beautiful] in town
We [we are] always together, together
We [we are] always together, together

Together [we disappear] in [in dark] [in street]
[We get out] [with smiles on our faces]
Passers-by us [avoid in a big circle]
We not [we need], not [we need] nobody
We not [we need], not [we need] nobody
