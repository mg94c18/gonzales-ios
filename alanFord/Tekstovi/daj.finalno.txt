These days
Although I didn't want {it}
I accidentally on {the} street
met you

And you, {just} like I,
are stealing days from God
I know, you have some {girl},
and have fun on {the} side

And I,
You don't know that I'm alone
in my world of silence
I lie {to} you that I have some {guy},
some {guy}, who cares about me

Come on,
Don't ask
Without you days feel stupid and empty to me
Come on, don't ask
Because without you I live this life as {if} by {a} punishment
