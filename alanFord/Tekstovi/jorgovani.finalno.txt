How many times I died
and you brought me back to life

How big a drunkard I was
and you sobered me up

What fires burned
and you were putting them out

At what bottom I was
and you saved me

After you, the soul remained as barren as a desert
After you, love is to me like mercy

There are nights when I pour sorrow instead of wine,
but there aren't as many days as wounds on the heart

You will {do} easily without me,
but how will I {do} without you?
when difficult days come,
when all friends go away,
when lilacs start to smell
