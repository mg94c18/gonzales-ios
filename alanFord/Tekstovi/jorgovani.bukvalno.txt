[How many] [I am] times [he died]
and you me [she revived]

[How big (he)] [I am] drunkard [he was]
and you me [she sobered up]

[What kind (all female)] [they are] fires [they (all female) burned]
and you them [she was putting out]

On [on what kind] [I am] [he was] [on bottom]
and you [you are] me [she saved]

After you [she is] [she remained] soul barren like desert
After you [to me] love comes like mercy

[Has] [of nights] when sorrow [I pour] [instead of] [of wine],
but [doesn't have] [of days] [how many] [it is] on heart [of wounds]

Easily [you will] you without me,
but how [I will] I without you?
when [they come] difficult days,
when [they go away] all friends,
when [they start to smell] lilacs
