...
You allow them to have you,
actors, directors,
reporters, men
unknown and known

They will use you up quickly
{those} big city beasts
but you will be
on {the} cover page

Maybe you will be a statist
in a movie here and there
Maybe you will record
an advertisement for a TV

They will exchange you like
they exchange words
Behind your back
they will tell jokes

You are {a} perfection with no flaw
You are {a} part of soldiers' dreams
You are {a} doll from {the} cover page
and you need money

Everyone loves your
ideal measurements
you will put up with old man's
hands on yourself

But that's {a} part
of your career,
so why, then,
wouldn't you put up {with it}?

{A} famous photographer
of {a} sex magazine
will take shots for his
art deed

Immature little boys
with {their} mouths open
will look {at} your
young naked body
