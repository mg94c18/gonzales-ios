Today there's no milk
Today there's no bread
Thus eat shit
maybe "That's the way"

They won't beat you up,
just be good
Today there's nobody,
today there's no people

Today there's no Sun,
today there's no sky
You don't even have yourself,
but that's the way

Today, scum just
looks down on you
Smacks you with {their} baton,
and throws {you} into a ditch

Today there's no milk
today there's no bread
Thus eat shit,
maybe that's the way

I have no strength
I have no idea
I don't have anything
So thus I'm going
to afterlife

And I'd better go into
a fir wood coffin
than to be red (communist)

Today there's no electricity,
today there's no water
It must not be heard,
there's no freedom either

Kosovo Albanians breeding,
fuck you, life
They have newborns,
but that's the way

Today there's no money,
new {notes} are being printed
Today there's no honor,
but there is government

It's not clear to me
who screwed me like that
I am croaking like a dog,
but that's the way
