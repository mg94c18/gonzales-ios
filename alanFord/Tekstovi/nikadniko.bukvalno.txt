Never you nobody [will not] [to love] like I
Never

Never you nobody [will not] [to love] like I
Lejla

Little [to us] [it needed], know
Just little, more one dream
For us [they would] [they blossomed] roses
if [you finished waiting] with me day

Birds [they would] us [with song] [they lead], know,
Sun [it would] [to us] [it lightened] way
For our happiness, and for you, darling
[I saved] love all.
Oh, only if [you stayed] here

But [you didn't want] that
But [you didn't want] that
