Come closer
Come closer
To be together

All is good
All is good
When we are together

We meet in the same place
For a long time, for a long time we stand in the corner
We are a happy bunch of guys

Our girls are the most beautiful in town
Our girls are the most beautiful in town
We are always together, together
We are always together, together

Together we disappear in a dark street
We get out with smiles on our faces
Passers-by avoid us in a big circle
We don't need, don't need anybody
We don't need, don't need anybody
