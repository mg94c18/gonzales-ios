What a good wine it was
that night when we were drinking
What a good wine it was
the night when we were happy

Wine opiated us
red and white
your lips {opiated} me
my body {opiated} you

What a warm evening it was
the evening when I met you
What a warm evening it was
when I lost myself

What fondling it was
whole life to me remembered
Oh, how I would like
that you stop by one more time
