Night program on radio
In kitchen are cockroaches
Water drips into sink
All _ this was [in vain]

Room full [of desperation]
[I don't have] [where to] neither to [I flee]
[All life] same shits
Beside you dead [I lie]

In two [they will] cleaners [to take away] garbage
In three [they will] [to bring] yogurt and milk
In six [you will] [to start going] on work
In eight, [I will] [to be] [far away]

[You're looking] smile on my face
[You don't have] notion what |he (the smile) hides
[I will send] you postcard
Greetings from Tunguzija
