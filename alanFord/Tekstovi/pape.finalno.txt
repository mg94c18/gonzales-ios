They told me the worst about you
They never spoke of themselves
They told me what they wanted
I believed, they were older

They told me that you had been everywhere
They told me that you had drank a lot
They told me what they knew
I believed, because I was little

Forgive me dad, all those harsh words
My life, too, now looks like yours
Forgive me dad, now I understand you
I am seeing your picture while looking at myself

They told me that you had kissed {many} women
On cards that you had been losing money
They told me what they knew
I believed, because I was little

They told me that you had blasphemed against God
They told me even more than that
They told me what they knew
I believed, because I was little

Forgive me dad, all those harsh words
My life, too, now looks like yours
Forgive me dad, that I was listening to others
I |am, dad, the same, because I tasted life
