Nobody will ever love you like I {do}
Never

Nobody will ever love you like I {do}
Lejla

Know {that} we needed a little,
Just a little, one more dream
The roses would have blossomed for us
if you had stayed with me till dawn

Know that birds would have lead us with a song
Sun would have lit the way for us
For our happiness, and for you, darling
I saved all the love.
Oh, if only you had stayed here

But you didn't want that
But you didn't want that

...

Know {that} we needed a little,
Just a little, one more dream
The roses would (now) blossom for us
if you had stayed with me till dawn

Know {that} birds would (now) lead us with a song
Sun would (now) light the way for us
For our happiness, and for you, darling
I saved all the love.
Oh, if only you had stayed here
