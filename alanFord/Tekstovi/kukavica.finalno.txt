Hug me
and go the road the cowards go
My wandering eyes will follow you
Woman's heart tender like swallow bird
that dies of pain

Hug me
Just once be a man, don't lie to me
If you go, don't look for me ever again
Just go ahead, don't make it hard on yourself, don't look at me
From long ago I apprehended everything

Coward
I didn't know you |are such a coward
You sleep with me, you lose sleep over another
You are afraid to admit that

Coward
You are just another coward
You think that I am that same little girl
who anyone can lie to
