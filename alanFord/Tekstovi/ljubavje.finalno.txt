When I was little,
for a long time I was not understanding
what is love,
to that, {my} father said to me:

"Love is when someone loves someone {else},
love is when you ache for someone,
love is when a mother loves a father,
when a sis loves a bro,

love is when someone loves someone {else},
love is when you ache for someone,
love is when a grandma loves a grandpa,
when a bro loves a sis,

love is when everyone in the world loves each other"

When I was little,
I asked my mother
what is love,
{my} mother said to me: "Sweetheart,
love is when someone loves..."
