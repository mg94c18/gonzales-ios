From beginning
[ever since] first day
yes, [like that] [we are] we

I [I am], [you say],
stubborn very
but same [you are] you

[They found] self together
hard heads two
equal [we are] both

So little [we worry] about love,
maybe once [we will be regretting] that

[We play] self we
[We play] self we
[We play] self, [we play] with happiness

[We play] self we
[We play] self we
[We play] and not [we think] about that

Little [I make a mistake] I
little more [you make a mistake] you
but in love
so often [they make a mistake] everybody

Hey, why
Hey, why
Hey, why not [we would] and we?

[I know] that [you think]
just you [I wait]
already years hundred

That [you are] guy
[of twentieth] century
and not [of just any]

But you [you are forgetting]
and I [I am] there
with you in that century

Let's more [we think] about love,
let [to us] |she (the love) again be everything
