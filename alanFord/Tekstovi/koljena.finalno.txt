Hey, my sweetheart,
get rid of {those} silly thoughts
from your beautiful crazy blonde head
Don't be {a} kid
Put on {the} slippers,
stay at home,
hug me gently and act naturally

Make me {a} coffee,
make {me} {a} sandwich,
host me nicely
and please me

Hey, my sweetheart,
dump {those} dolls
that chase {after} you and constantly bug you
Don't be {a} kid
Buy me dresses,
silver bracelets,
red raspberries and ticket to America

We know each other almost
ten days already,
give me your car
and keys to {your} apartment

Hey, {the} day smells of fresh milk
Birds sing from top of their lungs
{The} wind sways {the} morning
Touch my knees,
I would so like that

Hey, {the} blue sky rushes into apartment
{A} yellow butterfly fondles my neck
The wind sways the morning
Touch my knees,
I would so like that
