[They said] [to me] worst about you
[They were never speaking] about self
[They said] [to me] that what [they wanted]
[I believed], older [they were]

[They said] [to me] that [you were everywhere]
[They said] [to me] that [you drank a lot]
[They said] [to me] that what [they knew]
[I believed], because [I was] little

Forgive [to me] dad, all those harsh words
And my life now on your life [looks alike]
Forgive [to me] dad, now [I understand] you
[I am looking] your picture [while looking] self

[They said] [to me] that [you were kissing {many} women]
On cards that [you were losing money]
[They said] [to me] that what [they knew]
[I believed], because [I was] little

[They said] [to me] that [you cursed] God
[They said] [to me] above more that
[They said] [to me] that what [they knew]
[I believed], because [I was] little

Forgive [to me] dad, all those harsh words
And my life now on your life [looks alike]
Forgive [to me] dad, that [I was listening others]
I [I am], dad, same, because [I tasted life]
