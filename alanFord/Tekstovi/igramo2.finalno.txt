From {the} beginning
ever since {the} first day
yes, we're like that

I am, you say,
very stubborn,
but you are {the} same

Two hard heads
found each other
we are both equal

So little we worry about love,
maybe once we'll regret that

We play
We play
We play, we play with happiness

We play
We play
We play and we don't think about that

Sometimes I make a mistake,
a little more times you make a mistake,
but in love
so often everybody makes a mistake

Hey, why
Hey, why
Hey, why wouldn't we, too?

I know that you think
I wait just {for} you
already hundred years

That you are {a} guy
of twentieth century
and not of just any

But you are forgetting
I am there too
with you in that century

Let's think about love more,
may |she again be everything to us
