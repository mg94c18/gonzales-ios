A man was fishing
He was fishing, has been fishing the whole day
And then he caught a little golden fish
And then he caught a fisherman's dream

"Let me go," says the little fish,
"I will grant you one wish,
spend {your} life like nobody else,
in real happiness and joy."

"Really, just one?" fisherman asks,
"Till now it has always been three!
What kind of times came to be?
Maybe you are not golden after all."

"These times are what they are,
what do you care? say the wish,
spend {your} life like nobody else,
in real happiness and joy."

"Well, if it's like that, if you are like that,
go, may another man catch you,
I am not a man of one wish
and I will let you go out of... 'inat'."
