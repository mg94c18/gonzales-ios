Hug me
and [get going] [with road] [where to] [they go] cowards
[They will follow] you my eyes wanderers
Female heart tender like [swallow bird]
which of pain dies

Hug me
Just once man be, don't lie me
If [you go], never more don't seek me
Just forward, [don't torture self], don't look me
I [from a long time ago] [I am foreboding] everything

Coward
[I didn't know] that [you are] such coward
With me [you sleep], another [to you] is insomnia
[You are afraid] to [you admit] that

Coward
You [you are] just one more coward
[You think] that [I am] that same [little girl]
whom lies anyone
