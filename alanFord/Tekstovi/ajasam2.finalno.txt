Forgive {me} for taking your love
Forgive {me} for not giving {my} love to you
Because you only wanted a real love
because you loved me

And I drank red wine somewhere
And I was happy with another somewhere
And you, and you...
You were waiting for me

You were a woman which knows {how} to love
{even} when she cries, and when the tear hurts
You were a woman which knows {how} to wait
{for} the beloved man

The memory of past days pales
Maybe I repent, what does it matter now
May your hot tear hurt me
because you loved me
