[You are] ¿ alone [this evening]?
Yes ¿ [to you] [I am lacking] [this evening]?
Yes ¿ [to you] [it is] sorry, for, [let's say] dream?
Yes ¿ [to you] memory strays
all till sea and morning,
on shore when [I slept the night] there?


Yes ¿ [to you] things in room
[they lose] value and [they pale]?
Yes ¿ [you stare] in self's door
and [you wait] on me?

[It is] ¿ [to you] body full [of pain]?
Yes ¿ you [it feels cold] around [of table]?
Say [hey sweetheart], [you are] ¿ alone this night?

[I ask] self [you are] ¿ alone [this evening].
Sometimes [I hear] that [he is] world stage
and that everyone gets [as deserved],
like that it poet said.

Fate [she played a game] [by giving]
[to me] love with you my darling
Scene first: our introduction
[I feel in love with] you on first sight
You knew self's way,
[by never not losing] from sight what [you want]...

And then, scene second:
[you seemed] changed, [you acted] strange
and that I never not [find out] why, soul,
[you lied] when [you said] that me [you love],
and I [didn't have] reasons to [to you] not [I trust],
because, that is that.

But, I [I will] rather [to live] without you,
than [to listen] your lies.

Now, scene [it is] [that one],
I stand alone with [with emptiness] everywhere around self
You self believe [to me] more [you will not] [to taste sweetness],
and I [I know] that [it is] time and that self curtains [they are moving down].

[It is] ¿ [to you] body full [of pain]?
Yes ¿ you [it feels cold] around [of table]?
Say sweetheart, [you are] ¿ alone this night?

Thanks [the most beautiful], that [it was] all for [this evening],
thanks [the most beautiful], and [till seeing] another time;
Thanks beautiful
