If I was a white button
the babe would button-up herself in me

If I was a blue button
she would not know that I slept beside her

Hey, babe, hey
If I was a button

If I |was necklace all of gold
I would hug the babe around neck

I would be touching her the whole day,
the village doesn't know, her grandmother doesn't know
