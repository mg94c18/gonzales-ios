Your lips |are tasty
Your lips |were tasty

Our songs |are sad
Our songs |were sad

One woman remained
like a broken glass

This night you will not sleep
because you will only dream of me

...

Every day rain falls
from Split to Belgrade
Every day rain pours
from Dalmatia _ to Serbia

But that's not a real rain
which falls in vain
Yes, that's a rain that feels good
my dear Viktorija
That's just my eyes
greeting you in loneliness
