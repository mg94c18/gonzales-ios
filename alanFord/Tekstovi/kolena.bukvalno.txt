Hey, my [little soul],
[throw out] [little bugs]
from your beautiful crazy blue [little head]
Don't be kid
[Put on] slippers,
[hand over] [to me] [little pillow],
gently me hug and behave naturally

Cook me coffee,
make sandwich,
nicely host
and please me

Hey, my [little soul],
dump [little dolls]
which you chase and constantly you [they bug]
Don't be kid
Buy [to me] dresses,
silver bracelets,
red raspberries and ticket to America

[We know] self almost
already ten days,
give [to me] self's car
and key of apartment

Hey, on fresh milk [he smells] day
Birds [they sing] on whole voice
Morning sways wind
Touch [to me] knees,
that [I would] really [she loved]

Hey, blue sky [it hurries] into apartment
Yellow butterfly fondles my neck
Morning sways wind
Touch [to me] knees,
that [I would] really [she loved]
